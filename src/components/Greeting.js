      <p>This will be your assessment test to help me determine your skill level. This isn't timed and there are no multiple choice, correct or incorrect answers. I would like to see how you solve problems within the framework of the system that I've built, using the knowledge you have and being able to research and figure out what you don't already know.</p>

      <p>I've isolated what you need to modify this page and created an account to edit the code. Your login information is to the right. You have access to alter anything you want in this home directory. This is only a very small portion of a larger codebase but this should be all you need to complete the tasks.</p>

      <p>The site HTML uses the Bootstrap 4 framework so feel free to employ Bootstrap when generating HTML code. I also make heavy use of Vue.js for rendering js data objects into HTML which you will see in the first assessment. In addition Font Awesome Icons are available to use if you wish.</p>

      <p>These exercises are designed to mirror some of the coding and development challenges I see here at Euro-Wall. I know how I would solve these problems but that doesn't mean it's the right answer. I'm excited to see what solutions you employ. If you have any questions at all, please give me a call at 941-979-5316 or email me at jeff@euro-wall.com. I'm here to help in any way I can.</p>
